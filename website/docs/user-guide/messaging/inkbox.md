# Inkbox Messaging

Inkbox gives one Hermes identity a mailbox, a phone number, and an edge tunnel. The Hermes Inkbox adapter maps inbound email, SMS/MMS, and live voice calls into normal gateway sessions.

## Protocol Model

Inkbox is a multi-channel platform adapter, not just an SMS adapter:

- `message.received` webhooks become email turns.
- Inbound `text.received` webhooks are grouped into SMS/MMS turns.
- Other `text.*` webhooks are delivery/lifecycle callbacks and are logged without starting an agent turn.
- Incoming calls are answered by the adapter and bridged over `/phone/media/ws`.

Hermes uses the resolved Inkbox Contact as the primary `chat_id` when possible. That means email, SMS, and outbound voice can share one contact-scoped session. Unknown senders fall back to the raw email address or E.164 phone number.

## SMS Behavior

Inbound SMS can be buffered per contact before Hermes starts an agent turn. The quiet window is disabled by default so upstream deployments keep immediate SMS behavior; set `sms_text_batch_delay_seconds` or `INKBOX_SMS_TEXT_BATCH_DELAY_SECONDS` to a positive number when a deployment wants rapid human fragments, corrections, and follow-ups to arrive as one prompt instead of several competing prompts. A multi-message turn uses an `inkbox:sms_burst` routing marker and includes relative timestamps for each fragment.

If an SMS turn arrives while Hermes is already running for that contact, the gateway queues it for the next turn and merges later SMS follow-ups into the same pending prompt. SMS follow-ups do not interrupt the active run by default.

Slash commands bypass SMS batching and routing markers, so a text such as `/approve` or `/deny` reaches the Hermes command parser as a command rather than tagged SMS body text. Carrier protocol words such as `START`, `STOP`, `HELP`, `YES`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `INFO`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE` are treated as SMS control traffic and are acknowledged at the webhook layer without starting an agent turn.

Outbound SMS is queued with `identity.send_text(to=..., text=...)`. The adapter returns a `SendResult` with the Inkbox text id and non-body metadata such as `delivery_status`. Hermes does not chunk long SMS replies automatically; content over the Inkbox SMS limit fails before send with `sms_too_long` rather than being silently truncated.

Important SMS gates are enforced by Inkbox and carriers:

- New local numbers may need 10-15 minutes of carrier propagation before sending.
- Recipients must opt in by texting `START` to an org number.
- `STOP` opts a recipient out until they opt in again.
- Per-number SMS sending is rate limited.
- MMS media on inbound text records is surfaced as attachment metadata and a prompt-visible attachment marker.

Common structured send errors:

| Error code | Meaning | Retry behavior |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `sender_sms_pending` | Sender number is still provisioning | Do not immediate-retry |
| `messaging_profile_disabled` | Sender messaging profile is disabled upstream/provider-side | Do not retry content variants; check provisioning |
| `recipient_not_opted_in` | Recipient has not opted in with `START` | Do not retry |
| `recipient_opted_out` | Recipient sent `STOP` | Do not retry |
| `rate_limited` / send-limit errors | Per-number or provider send limit | Wait for the provider window |
| `sms_too_long` | Hermes response exceeds the SMS size limit | Shorten the response or use another channel |
| HTTP 5xx / transient provider errors | Provider temporarily unavailable | Retry with backoff |

Hermes preserves these failures in `SendResult.raw_response` with `status_code`, `error_code`, `category`, and `retryable`. Provider-gated SMS failures disable the generic plain-text fallback because changing message formatting does not fix provisioning, consent, or carrier state.

## Webhook Safety

By default the adapter requires Inkbox webhook signatures:

```bash
INKBOX_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true
INKBOX_SIGNING_KEY=...
```

For local-only testing you can set `INKBOX_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=false`, but production deployments should keep signature verification enabled.

The adapter deduplicates webhooks by `X-Inkbox-Request-Id` and also deduplicates inbound SMS by Inkbox text id. This protects against duplicate agent runs when webhook retries arrive with a new request id.

## Configuration

The installer configures Inkbox automatically. Manual deployments use:

```bash
INKBOX_API_KEY=...
INKBOX_IDENTITY=your-agent-handle
INKBOX_SIGNING_KEY=...
INKBOX_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-public-host.example   # optional when not using the SDK tunnel
INKBOX_LISTEN_PORT=8765
INKBOX_HOME_CHANNEL=contact-or-phone
```

Use `INKBOX_BASE_URL` only for staging or development environments.
